# Orientation & Instruction

This repository contains a simple program written in Golang named `pinger`. This service reponds with `"hello world"` at the root path and can be configured to ping another server through the environment variables (see the file at `./cmd/pinger/config.go`). By default, running it will make it start a server and ping itself.

A basic `Makefile` is provided that allows you to:

- pull in dependencies - `make dep`
- builds the binaries - `make build`
- test runs - `make run`
- run tests - `make test`

You may modify the above recipes according to your needs/wants but avoid modifying those tagged with `# DO NOT CHANGE THIS` as we will be using those to validate your work.


## Pre-requisites

You will need the following installed:

- `go` to run the application (check with `go version`)
- `docker` for image building/publishing (check with `docker version`)
- `docker-compose` for environment provisioning (check with `docker-compose version`)
- `git` for source control (check with `git -v`)
- `make` for simple convenience scripts (check with `make -v`)

You will also need the following accounts:

- GitLab.com ([click here to register/login](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in))


## Directory structure

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/bin` | Contains binaries |
| `/cmd` | Contains source code for CLI interfaces |
| `/deployments` | Contains image files and manifests for deployments |
| `/docs` | Contains documentation |
| `/vendor` | Contains dependencies (use `make dep` to populate it) |



## Task Overview

**There are 4 tasks** you need to complete. The section on [Versioning](#versioning-bonus) is a bonus section if you'd like to push yourself (: there is no time limit on this, feel free to modify your setup up till the face-to-face interview.

| Task | Weightage |
| --- | --- |
| [Containerisation](#containerisation) | 40% |
| [Pipeline](#pipeline) | 30% |
| [Environment](#environment) | 20% |
| [Documentation](#documentation) | 10% |
| [Versioning (Bonus)](#versioning-bonus) | 20% |


## Get Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your own repository on GitLab
3. Set your local repository's remote to point to your GitLab repository
4. Make your changes locally according to the tasks below
5. Push to your GitLab repository

# Containerisation

> **REMINDER**: this will form 40% of your assessment



## Context

Not everyone has Go installed locally! Let's make it easier for developers to run this without installing anything.


## Task

Create a `Dockerfile` in the `./deployments/build` directory according to any best practices you may know about. You may write tests as you see fit.



## Deliverable

Running `docker build -f ./deployments/build/Dockerfile -t devops/pinger:latest .` should result in a successful image named `devops/pinger:latest` which is reflected in the output of `docker image ls`.

Running `docker run -it -p 8000:8000 devops/pinger:latest` should result in the same behaviour as running `go run ./cmd/pinger`.

You can test if this works by running:

```sh
# to test the build
make docker_image;

# to test the runtime
make docker_testrun;
```


## Notes

- If you encounter errors while running the image given best practices you may find elsewhere online, it is part of the challenge, debug it and show us what you've got(:

# Pipeline

> **REMINDER**: this will form 30% of your assessment



## Context

Automation is key in DevOps to deliver value continuously and the first step we can take for this poor un-automated repository is to create a sensible pipeline that automates the build/test/release process. Since we might not be pushing to a Docker registry, save the created Docker image into a tarball (see `docker_tar` and `docker_untar` in the Makefile for more info!)


## Task

Create a pipeline that results in:

1. The binary being built
2. Docker image being built

The following should also be exposed as GitLab job artifacts:

1. The binary itself
2. Docker image in `.tar` format


## Deliverable

`.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of this directory that results in a successful build on your own repository with the required artifacts available for download.

# Environment

> **REMINDER**: this will form 20% of your assessment


## Context

Developers have been running this manually forever in an isolated setting, let's put a use case to it and demonstrate how it maybe used downstream the value chain!


## Task

Create a `docker-compose.yml` in the `./deployments` to demonstrate two `pinger` services that ping each other


## Deliverable

Running `docker-compose up -f ./deployments/docker-compose.yml` should result in a network of at least 2 Docker containers that are pinging each other with the other acting as an echo server. Exposing the logs should reveal them pinging each other at their different ports.

You can test if this works by running:

```sh
make testenv;
```

# Documentation

> **REMINDER**: this will form 10% of your assessment


## Context

Now that you've added some DevOps tooling to this project, it's time to document it together with the poorly documented code.


## Task

Write a README.md in the `./docs` directory that contains instructions on how to operate this repository. The README should be as concise as possible while enabling anyone new to this project to get started as quickly as possible.


## Deliverable

README.md in the `./docs` directory.

To check if this has been delivered, run:

```sh
make verify_readme;
```

# Versioning (Bonus)

Note that this requires that the [Pipeline Section](#pipeline) is complete.

> **REMINDER**: this provides an additional 20% to your assessment


## Context

When referring to problems, we often use a version number. The (arguably) leading way to do this is via semver (eg. 1.15.2). Let's apply versioning to what we did!


## Task

Your pipeline probably has multiple stages (regardless of in YAML structure/in logic), add additional scripting to bump the version of this repository using Git tags, and add this version to the produced Docker image too. The versioning strategy is up to you to decide.


## Deliverable

On the GitLab CI pipeline page, we can manually trigger a CI pipeline run. Assuming you are at version X, triggering a CI pipeline run should bump the version to version Y, where X comes before Y in any logical sequence.
